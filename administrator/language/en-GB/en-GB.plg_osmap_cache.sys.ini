PLG_OSMAP_CACHE="OSMap - Sitemap Cache"
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_DESCRIPTION="Provides sitemap caching."

PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_AUTO_CACHE_TIME_LABEL="Cache Time"
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_AUTO_CACHE_TIME_DESC="The maximum length of time in minutes for a cached sitemap to be stored before it is refreshed. Leave as 0 to disable the automatic refresh."
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE_LABEL="Cache Chunk Size"
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_CHUNK_SIZE_DESC="The maximum number of items the cache will return on each iteration. Since the result is grabbed from the database and temporarily stored in an array, we use chunks to avoid use too much memory. The optimal value will vary based on your available resources and number of items in the sitemap. Lower values reduce the memory used by PHP but increase the number of requests to the database. Higher values increase the memory used by PHP but reduce the number of requests to the database. To disable chunks, use 0."
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_CRONJOB_TOKEN_LABEL="Cronjob Refresh Token"
PLG_OSMAP_CACHE_CRONJOB_TOKEN_DESC="Random string to protect the URL which is called in a cronjob to trigger the update of a sitemap cache."
